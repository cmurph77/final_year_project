<!-- 
    This will add two (destination-)rerouters to our network making the 
    vehicles go around the circle until the given end time (i.e., until 
    one hundred million seconds have passed). Effectively, each rerouter
     will update the destination for each vehicle entering its edge 
     (specified by its edge-attribute) and set it to the edge given in the 
     id-attribute of the destProbReroute-element. So as soon as a vehicle 
     enters edge1 (its current destination), its destination will be updated
      to edge2 and vice-versa, when entering edge2 it will be rerouted towards
       edge1, thus following a circular route. -->
